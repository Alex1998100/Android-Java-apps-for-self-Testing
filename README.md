To be honest, this is very strong skills and if I made some projects in another environment, I need a way to quick remember this environment, quick switch from other environment.
This application can not included question, you need upload you own question in my pattern what you will see in Assets directory.
Also you can simple rebuild my application from Assets to external directory, but unfortunately rules to working with external directory need additional efforts, for example Google forbid working with *.txt file for ordinary phone apps. There are other difficulties, therefore in my quick application (I have been built it for one day) I select simplest and fastest way.
My application working with Firebase. If you don't need Firebase, you can use this apps without Firebase.However Firebase allow save some notes for questions. I made this application simple as possible, therefore your notes you can see only in Firebase console.
And I try to avoid any stupid and hard authentication procedures required by Firebase.
Therefore I restrict access simple as possible - just with individual Phone ID - without binding your Phone ID to Facebook-Microsoft-Email of other account, what usually required by Google. You just need to go to Auth table and take your phone ID from this place.
